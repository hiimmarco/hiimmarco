### Hi there 👋

I'm Marco and I am a web developer with former experience as a product owner. I used to to use user research, analytics and search engine optimisation techniques to improve the user experience while also using agile project management methodologies to drive and support the development process of websites like bergwelten.com, servus.com and terramatermagazin.com.

👷‍♂️ Now I love building things myself.

## What I value

- 💪 Teamwork
- 💬 Honesty
- 🎓 Learning & Improving
- 🐕‍🦺 Help & Support
- 🤪 Fun
